# Solidity copy⚡️  
The goal of this tiny project was to try to copy the main page of the Solidity project with the use of HTML and __Sass__. I've felt as if I've been neglecting basics of CSS, semantic HTML and various CSS transitions and animations, so I've found this excercise to be a pretty calming learning experience.  
The hamburger menu is not yet ready, so the copy is not fully functional.
