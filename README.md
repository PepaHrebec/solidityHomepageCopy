# First example of my "Copy an actual website" project - ⚡Solidity⚡
The goal of this tiny project was to try to copy the main page of the Solidity project with the use of HTML and __Sass__. I've felt as if I've been neglecting basics of CSS, semantic HTML and various CSS transitions and animations, so I've found this excercise to be a pretty calming learning experience.
