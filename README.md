# solidityHomepageCopyâš¡
## First example of my "Copy an actual website" project
The goal of this tiny project was to try to copy the main page of the Solidity project with the use of HTML and _Sass_. I've felt as if I've been neglecting basics of CSS, semantic HTML and various CSS transitions and animations, so I've found this excercise to be a pretty calming learning experience.
